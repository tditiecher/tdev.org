TDev.org is my personal website, a place to show my interests to the rest of the
world. My name is Taco Ditiecher and I am a professional software developer
working for the City of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. My main focus is on the
Microsoft.NET platform but once in a while I open my eyes and have a look at
other ecosystems like ruby and javascript.

When I'm not at my computer I probably can be found in the
[aikido dojo](http://aikidospijkenisse.nl/) practicing my own techniques or teaching children.

Thank you for your interest in me and my website,

Taco.
